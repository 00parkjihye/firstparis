        Paris is the capital and most populous city of France, with an estimated
        population of 2,148,271 residents as of 2020, in an area of 105 square
        kilometres. Since the 17th century, Paris has been one
        of Europe's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion,
        science and arts. The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government
        of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an estimated official
        2020 population of 12,278,210, or about 18 percent of the population of
        France. The Paris Region had a GDP of €709 billion in
        2017. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of
        Living Survey in 2018, Paris was the second most expensive city in the
        world, after Singapore, and ahead of Zürich, Hong Kong, Oslo and Geneva.
        Another source ranked Paris as most expensive, on a par with Singapore
        and Hong Kong, in 2018. The city is a major railway, highway and
        air-transport hub served by two international airports: Paris–Charles de
        Gaulle and Paris–Orly.</p> 

        <p class="article_wiki_b">
        Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million
        passengers daily; it is the second busiest metro system in Europe
        after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th busiest railway station
        in the world, but the first located outside Japan, with 262 million
        passengers in 2015. Paris is especially known for its museums and
        architectural landmarks: the Louvre was the most visited art museum in
        the world in 2019, with 9.6 million visitors. The Musée d'Orsay, Musée
        Marmottan Monet, and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their
        collections of French Impressionist art, the Pompidou Centre Musée
        National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and
        contemporary art in Europe, and the Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso
        exhibit the works of two noted Parisians. The historical district along
        the Seine in the city centre is classified as a UNESCO Heritage Site,
        and popular landmarks in the city centre included the Cathedral of Notre
        Dame de Paris on the Île de la Cité, now closed for renovation after the
        15 April 2019 fire. Other popular tourist sites include the Gothic royal
        chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, also on the Île de la Cité; the Eiffel Tower,
        constructed for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889; the Grand Palais
        and Petit Palais, built for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900; the
        Arc de Triomphe on the Champs-Élysées, and the Basilica of Sacré-Coeur
        on the hill of Montmartre.</p>
